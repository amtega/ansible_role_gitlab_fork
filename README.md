This is an [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) role to manage a GitLab project fork.

## Role Variables

A list of all the default variables for this role is available in `defaults/main.yml`.

The role setups the following facts:

- `gitlab_fork_fact`: dictionary with the result of the fork

## Example Playbook

This is an example playbook:

``` yaml

  roles:  
    - amtega.gitlab_fork
  vars:    
    gitlab_fork_project_path: /myproject

- `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE`: path to the file containing the vault password required for the previous inventory (optional)

```shell
cd amtega.gitlab_fork

ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=~/myinventory ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/myvaultpassword molecule test
```
